# CRISP Open Source License

## 1. Preamble

Health information exchange is most impactful and successful when parties cooperate and collaborate. These same principles apply to software development. This agreement is modeled on the “MIT License”.

WHEREAS it is mutually beneficial to all parties, including our patients, when advancements in technology are shared; and

WHEREAS collaboration will create opportunities to leverage efficiencies of scale, disseminate use cases, and encourage innovation;

NOW THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed between the Parties as follows:

1.1) The products of this collaboration are intended to serve the broader healthcare community.

1.2) Leveraging the work of the community and not contributing violates the spirit of collaboration.

1.3) If a Party violates the spirit of collaboration, other Parties will have cause to think disparaging thoughts about the offending Party.

1.4) Nothing in this Preamble section shall limit the terms of the agreement as described in Section 2 License.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
